# whimsy-chat

Concept: Z-Chat is a messaging app focused on simplicity and a touch of whimsy.

Core Features:

Black and White Interface: The entire app is rendered in black and white, creating a sleek and modern aesthetic. This also reduces eye strain and makes it battery-friendly.
ZooZoo Animatronic Typing: As you type, a small ZooZoo character (those adorable black and white creatures) appears at the bottom of the screen. The ZooZoo animates to reflect your typing speed â€“ faster typing makes the ZooZoo more energetic.
Basic Messaging: Similar to WhatsApp, you can send text messages, emojis, and voice notes (although these wouldn't be black and white).
Additional Ideas:

Customization: Allow users to choose different ZooZoo characters or color accents within the black and white theme for a touch of personalization.
Disappearing Messages: Introduce a "secret chat" mode where messages vanish after a set time, adding a layer of privacy.
Focus on Text: Since the app is minimalist, consider features that enhance text communication, like message formatting options (bold, italics) or quick reply templates.
